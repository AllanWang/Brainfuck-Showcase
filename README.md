# Too many instructions to remember in your preferred programming language?<br><br>Try Brainf*ck

Brainf*ck is a "simple" language with only 8 instructions; they are hard to forget, but also pretty hard to use extensively.
This is a Java [compiler](https://github.com/AllanWang/Brainfuck-Showcase/blob/master/src/brainfuck/Compiler.java) for Brainf*ck, as well as some code snippers for my attempt at using it.
Good luck!
